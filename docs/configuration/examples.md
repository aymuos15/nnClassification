## How to Use These Examples

### Option 1: Copy to Custom Config

```bash
# Create configs directory
mkdir -p configs

# Copy example to file
cat > configs/production.yaml << 'EOF'
# Paste Example 2 content here
EOF

# Use it
ml-train --config configs/production.yaml
```

### Option 2: Modify Base Config

```bash
# Edit ml_src/config_template.yaml directly
nano ml_src/config_template.yaml

# Paste example content

# Train
ml-train
```

### Option 3: Use CLI Overrides

## Quick Start Recommendations

**First time using the framework?** Start here:

1. **Try Example 1 (Quick Testing)**
   - Verifies everything works
   - Fast feedback (5 epochs)

2. **Adapt Example 2 (Production)**
   - Change `data_dir` to your dataset
   - Adjust `num_classes`
   - Train for real

3. **Experiment with CLI overrides**
   ```bash
   ml-train --batch_size 32 --lr 0.01
   ```

4. **Create your own config**
   - Copy closest example
   - Modify for your needs
   - Save in `configs/` directory

---

## Tips for Configuration

1. **Start simple** - Use default config first
2. **Change one thing at a time** - Easier to understand effects
3. **Document changes** - Note why you changed defaults
4. **Version control configs** - Track configuration evolution
5. **Name configs meaningfully** - `production.yaml`, `debug.yaml`, etc.
6. **Test on small data first** - Verify config before full training
7. **Monitor TensorBoard** - Watch metrics during training
8. **Save successful configs** - Keep configs that worked well

---

## Common Adjustments

### Faster Training
- Increase `batch_size` (e.g., 32 â†’ 64)
- Increase `num_workers` (e.g., 4 â†’ 8)
- Reduce `num_epochs` initially
- Use smaller model (MobileNet, EfficientNet-B0)

### Better Accuracy
- More `num_epochs`
- Larger model (ResNet50 â†’ EfficientNet-B7)
- Higher resolution (224 â†’ 512)
- Pretrained weights (`weights: 'DEFAULT'`)

### Less Memory
- Reduce `batch_size`
- Reduce image `resize`
- Use smaller model
- Reduce `num_workers`

### Debugging Issues
- Set `deterministic: true`
- Set `num_workers: 0`
- Reduce `batch_size` to 2
- Use `device: 'cpu'`
- Use TinyNet model
